## Editors

# Sublime Text

Configure an editor to be used from the command line. Sublime Text has a gotcha that causes its running environment to get messed up when launched from the command line. [[You can avoid it using "start" to launch it.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10438508/error6-while-trying-to-use-sublime-text-to-msbuild)

TCC format: 

@alias edit=`start "Sublime Text" "c:\program files\sublime text 3\sublime_text.exe" %*`


# Atom

# Visual Studio Code
