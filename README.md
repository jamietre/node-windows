#Overview
###What is this?

A reference for using Windows-based toolset with Node.js and the command line.

Using Node and NPM is a bit of a challenge with Windows compared to *nix based systems (Linux, Mac OS, etc.), mostly because the command line toolset is different.  But with a little effort you can get a good command line working environment that's well integrated with Windows. 

The biggest challenge is the lack of good information about how to configure your environment correctly. This document hopes to provide a resource to address this by providing information about best-in-class tools, and help with configuration and Windows-specific problems.


###Contents

1. [Get your environment set up](./environment.md). The hardest part with windows is just getting everything working. Learn about replacements for the DOS shell, and getting node, git and npm set up.
2. Editors (todo)
2. [Using npm](./npm.md). A basic rundown of npm. 
3. [Using npm](./npm.md). Git configuration and common scenarios. 
4. [Set up a Linux VM](./linux-vm.md). Sometimes it just won't work on windows; this will guide you through setting up a nearly transparent Linux VM with Vagrant and VirtualBox
5. [Debugging Node with Node Inspector](./node-inspector.md). A simple way to debug node.js apps using the Chromium debugger.
6. Sinopia (todo)
7. TCC plugins (todo)
