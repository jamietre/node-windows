#Overview
###What is this?

A living document to help you set up an effective Windows-based toolset with Node.js and the command line.

Using Node and NPM is a bit of a challenge with Windows compared to *nix based systems (Linux, Mac OS, etc.), mostly because the command line toolset is different.  But with a little effort you can get a good command line working environment that's well integrated with Windows. 

The biggest challenge is the lack of good information about how to configure your environment correctly. This document hopes to provide a resource to address this by providing information about best-in-class tools, and help with configuration and Windows-specific problems.
